			    (IASMUN), driven by a shared vision for diplomacy and global awareness. They laid a strong foundation with creativity
			    and enthusiasm, transforming IASMUN into a dynamic space for students to discuss, debate, and innovate solutions to
				global challenges. Their leadership inspired a culture of collaboration and critical thinking that has continued to
			    shape IASMUN's legacy. <br> <br> Guided by the insights of these founders, the 2024 seniors took IASMUN to new heights in its second edition in January
			    2024, with nine committees and over 250 delegates—an impressive expansion that solidified IASMUN’s reputation as a leading
			    MUN conference. <br> <br> Now, as IASMUN moves into its third edition in 2025, under the dedicated leadership of current juniors and seniors, the
			    conference continues to grow and evolve. With fresh ideas and an unwavering commitment to global issues, the 2025 team
			    is committed to enhancing the IASMUN experience even further, ensuring it remains a platform for impactful diplomacy
			    and meaningful connections. Each year builds on the dreams of those before, preserving IASMUN’s enduring spirit and
